"Getting and Cleaning Data" Project
============================================

This repository contains the files used to complete the project for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course of the Coursera JHU Data Science specialization. The goal of the assignment is to produce two tidy data sets from a source data set using an R script, and to provide sufficient documentation. Among the most important files in this repository are:

- `source/`: A directory containing Version 1.0 of the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" provided by *Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory* referred to as the source data set.
- `run_analysis.R`: A commented R script used to create tidy data sets and information from the source data set.
- `CodeBook.md`: A code book describing the tidy data sets.
- `tidy_data.csv`, `tidy_data_avg.csv`: The tidy data sets.
